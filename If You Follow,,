And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying,
If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 40But the other answering
rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the
same condemnation? 41And we indeed justly; for we receive the due
reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. 

42And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into
thy kingdom. 43And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee,
To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.

Luke 24:41-45
And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” 42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 43 and he took it and ate it in their presence.

44 He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.” Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.
