And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying,
If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 40But the other answering
rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the
same condemnation? 41And we indeed justly; for we receive the due
reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. 

42And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into
thy kingdom. 43And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee,
To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
