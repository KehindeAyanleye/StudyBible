And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying,
If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 40But the other answering
rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the
same condemnation? 41And we indeed justly; for we receive the due
reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. 

42And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into
thy kingdom. 43And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee,
To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.

Luke 24:30-31
When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. 31 Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. 

Luke 24:41-45
And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” 42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 43 and he took it and ate it in their presence.

44 He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.” 
Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.

Psalm 69:9
For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up;(got me reading this verse, further this)
Psalm 69:5
O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.(This proves my imperfection but not withstanding by
quecnh for perfection)
Over the course of last week I realised I was sinking with responsibilties, I realised that a verse of the bible could be right
for this occasion and that verse says it just as Jesus himself had said it. Came yea that are busy and are heavy laden, come
to me and I'll give you rest, take my burden upon you and cast it(I have to go read it...)

Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me, for I am gentle (meek) and humble (lowly) 
in heart, and you will find rest (relief and ease and refreshment and recreation
and blessed quiet) for your souls. [Jer. 6:16.]30 For My yoke is wholesome
(useful, good–not harsh, hard, sharp, or pressing, but comfortable,
gracious, and pleasant), and My burden is light and easy to be borne.
