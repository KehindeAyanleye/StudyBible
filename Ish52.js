For thus saith the Lord, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.

How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!

For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the Lord will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rearward. Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. (‭Isaiah‬ ‭52‬:‭3, 7, 12-13‬ KJV).
