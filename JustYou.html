Isaiah 44

The Lord declare that I'm his servant, and also his chosen one.

He affirms that He made and formed me even from the womb.

So he says, I shouldn't fear. He said he is pouring water on my thirsty land and flood upon my dry ground.

Also, he says that he will pour his spirit on me and my seeds and descedants. not only his spirit, but his
blessings and these will spring me up among the grass, just as willows by the water course.

I am the first, I am the last, and beside me there's no one, says God of heaven.

Isaiah 45
